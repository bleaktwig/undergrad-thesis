\secnumbersection{SOLUTION VALIDATION} \label{sec:val}

% Note: I could add the validation of each version by mentioning how many tracks are found in each and comparing them with the original tracks found through statistical error.
% Note: Number of tracks found per version by iterating through 10.000 events:
%     v1.0 : 15.575 - 11.248
%     v1.1 : 15.608 - 11.261
%     v1.2 : 15.606 - 11.259
%     v1.3 : 15.606 - 11.257
