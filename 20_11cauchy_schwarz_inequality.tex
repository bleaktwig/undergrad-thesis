\subsection{Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality} \label{add:cauchy_schwarz}
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality is a very useful inequality which states that, if $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are any vectors inside an inner product space, it can be proven that:
    \begin{equation*}
        |\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle| \leq \|\mathbf{u}\|\|\mathbf{v}\|\,,
    \end{equation*}
where $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ is the inner product~\cite{strang2005linear}.

Considering that the expectation of a product of two random variables is an inner product, this leads to the covariance inequality:
    \begin{equation*}
        |\text{cov}(x,y)|^2 \leq \text{var}(x)\text{var}(y)\,,
    \end{equation*}
where $\text{var}(\cdot)$ denotes the variance of a variable and $\text{cov}(\cdot,\cdot)$ the covariance between two, and are defined in Appendix \ref{add:covariance_matrix}.
