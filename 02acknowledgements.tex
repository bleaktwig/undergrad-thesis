I thank professor Claudio Torres for helping me through the development of this document and the project evidenced in it, and professors Hayk Hakobyan and Raquel Pezoa for assisting me during its conclusion.
I also thank professors Javier Ca\~nas, Horst Von Brand, Silvio Olate, Chiu Hui Sun Lin and Mois\'es Ca\~nas for the knowledge they passed onto me through my academic years.

I thank the Jefferson Laboratories institution for allowing me to work with them, and in particular Veronique Ziegler and Vardan Gyurjyan for personally assisting me during the development of this project.

I thank my mother Isabel Balbontin and my father Walter Benkel for doing everything in their power to ensure I had the best possible education up until and including my university years, while also thanking my two sisters Paula and Natalia for their love and support.
In the same way, I thank my grandparents ``Opa'' Klaus Benkel and ``Oma'' Hedi Opitz for providing me with excellent role models in both a professional and personal sense.

I deeply thank my girlfriend Eli Stensberg without whose love and care I wouldn't have been able to finish this project and remain sane in the process, and I also take the opportunity to apologize for my constant cranky mood during it.
I also thank the other students with whom I shared the pain and glory of higher education, with the special mention of Francisco Casas, who personally helped me through the development of this project and even more so during its conclusion.
