\secnumbersection{SOLUTION PROPOSAL} \label{sec:prop}

The approach used to improve on the software's computing time followed a logical order.
First, the algorithm is exhaustively analyzed and profiled to find the bottlenecks in the execution, so as to be able to focus the work on them.
Then, the cause for each significant bottleneck is identified and investigated, so as to propose solutions using the state of the art in the field, and after a good understanding of each problem is reached, they are addressed.
Finally, thorough validation sessions are attempted so as to be sure that the changes made don't affect negative the software's results and to secure that the computing time is effectively reduced.
